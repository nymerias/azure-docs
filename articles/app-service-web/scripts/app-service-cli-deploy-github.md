# Create a web app with deployment from GitHub

This sample script does the following using Azure CLI 2.0:

* Create a web app in Azure App Service in the West Europe Azure region.
* Deploy your web app code from GitHub.
* Display the deployed Azure web app in the browser.

## Prerequisites

* Run `az login` to log in to Azure.
* Put your web app code in a GitHub repository.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a public GitHub repository you don't own, App Service will deploy code from that GitHub repository, but
> cannot set up the SSH key and webhooks necessary for continuous deployment.
>
>
